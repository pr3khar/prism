                The domain for Prism is AI in Mental Healthcare. Prism learns the mind of the user at a particular time to manipulate the reality as the user needs. Prism forms an intimate and personal relationship with the users at all times in order to alter their reality as they wish to see. It keeps their mental well being in check, at a micro as well as a macro level. The aim of the future is to help people cope with their daily mental health issues that are often left unnoticed, even by themselves.

            <div class = "sub-title">PURPOSE</div>
            <div class = "text">
                While technology has enabled the world to be more connected, there is a consistent decline in meaningful human interaction. The rates of depression and anxiety across the world are increasing by as much as 60% in some places and large portions of those affected do not get appropriate help. Rise of AI and an overwhelming demand for mental healthcare inevitably lead to Prism - a personal AI powered coping mechanism.
                Prism can infer the users’ mental state, fears and wants, and generates personalized visual feedback to drastically aid their mental wellbeing. Prism can start by adding minimal cues to the users’ view, like making them feel as if it's the middle of the day when they have to work late at night. As users adapt to Prism, it can start to alter more significant portions of their lives, increasing the depth of the bond it creates with the user. As the Prism blends into the users’ lives, it slowly becomes difficult to distinguish the real world from Prism.

            <div class = "text">
                Trend analysis on the rising rates of mental health issues and the rapid integration of AI in all domains was used to concoct Prism. AI today can infer complex human emotions, and will be able to predict the best remedies. The technique of Scenarios was used for further world-building by developing the evolution of the users’ interactions. Prism is inherently close to each user, more than even some humans; this intimacy can slowly make Prism a part of the reality in users’ awareness.

            <div class = "sub-title">DESIGN FICTION TECHNIQUE</div>
            <div class = "text">
                The design fiction technique we have used to represent the prop is Diegetic Prototype or a film. There are mainly three components in the film. First part is the introduction to the purpose and origin, it includes the world building of what the world is currently. Second component is the introduction of Prism. The final component of the film is the creator of Prism who walks the audience through the complete journey of the product. The creator is the main protagonist of the film.

                TOPIC x PROPOSAL FOR CHANGE
                <br>
                The topic of the imagined future aims to overcome the stigma of mental health issues, and address it in an intimate manner. The topic is to manipulate the negativity that we witness in our everyday moments into positive scenes.
                <br>
                PURPOSE x REFLECTIVENESS
                <br>
                The purpose of Prism makes us realise how we regard our surroundings in an oblivious manner, that there is a required need to alter them in order to make us feel content. It makes the audience more self aware of how they wish to perceive what they see. 
                <br>
                INTERACTIVITY x ENHANCING APPRECIATION
                <br>
                The output of what the user witnesses from the Prism is a completely imaginative version of the reality, according to what they want to see. This makes us aware of the advancement and complexity that the technology today is capable of. The reality presented is not a virtual world, but just a manipulation of the real world, real people, real situations.
